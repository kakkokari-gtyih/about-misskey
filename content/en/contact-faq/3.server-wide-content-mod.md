question: Could you delete the content on local/remote server?

The Misskey Project is an organization that develops Misskey, but does not provide any Misskey server-related services. Therefore, **if you contact us via the form below, we are unable to address your request.**

Content moderation on individual servers is conducted according to the rules of each server. If you wish to have content removed, please contact the administrator of the server where the content originated, or you can block the user or server as a self-defense measure.
