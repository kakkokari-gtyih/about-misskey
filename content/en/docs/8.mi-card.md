:::tip

Any method of support and any period of time is acceptable for calculating the cumulative support amount.
For example, if you donate 5,000 yen via PayPal in 2023, 12,000 yen via Fanbox in 2024, and a gift of 3,000 yen worth via Amazon's Wish List in 2024, your total support would be 5,000 + 12,000 + 3,000 = 20,000 yen.

### Options

If you prefer, we can send you a card with “syuilo” autograph on the back.(Free)

- Autograph of Ai-Chan is engraved on every plan.
- The design is also on the back of the card, but syuilo will write the autograph over it with a marker pen.As a result, the design will be messed up, so please consider carefully before deciding whether to select this option.
- There is a possibility that syuilo may get nervous or otherwise mess up writing the autograph. Even in that case, we will ship it as is.
