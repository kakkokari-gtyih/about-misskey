# Obtaining an Access Token via MiAuth

To get an access token for users (hereinafter simply referred to as "users") who will use your application, follow these steps:

:::tip

The method described below is called MiAuth, which allows instant access token issuance without creating an app.

- [There is also a more widely used OAuth method for obtaining access tokens.](./oauth.md)
- [You can also get access tokens through the app creation method (legacy method).](./app.md)

:::

## Step 1

Generate a UUID.This will be used as the **Session ID**.

:::danger

Generate a new session ID each time and do not reuse them.

:::

## Step 2

Display the application authentication form in the user's browser.You can open the authentication form using a URL in the following format:

```
https://{host}/miauth/{session}
```

Here,

- Replace `{host}` with the user's server host.Usually, the host is input by the user.
- Replace `{session}` with the session ID.

You can also set several options as query parameters in the URL:

| Name         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | The name of the application.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `icon`       | The URL of the application's icon image.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `callback`   | The URL to redirect to after authentication.<br>The session ID will be added as a `session` query parameter on redirect.                                                  |
| `permission` | The permissions required by the application.<br>List the required permissions separated by commas.Check the list of permissions [here](../permission.md). |

```

:::

## Step 3

After the user grants access to the application, make a POST request to a URL in the following format to receive a JSON response containing the access token.

```
https://{host}/api/miauth/{session}/check
```

Here,

- Replace `{host}` with the user's server host.
- Replace `{session}` with the session ID.

The properties included in the response are as follows:

| Name    | Description                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `token` | The user's access token.    |
| `user`  | Information about the user. |
