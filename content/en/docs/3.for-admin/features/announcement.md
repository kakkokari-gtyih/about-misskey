# Announcements

Announcements are one of the features available in Misskey.

Using the announcement feature, you can post server-wide announcements to users, as well as send messages from the server to individual users.

:::warning

アクティブなお知らせの数が多いと、特に新規ユーザーの確認作業が増え、UXが低下する可能性があります。その場合、以下のオプションを検討できます。

- Create an announcement with the "Existing Users Only" option enabled
- Create an announcement with the "do not notify" option enabled
- Archive closed announcements.

## Display format

You can select from the following types of display formats.

- **Normal** ... Announcements will be posted on the Announcements page.
- **Banner** ... In addition to appearing on the announcements page a banner will appear at the top of the user's screen.
- **Dialog** ... お知らせ一覧ページへの掲載に加えて、クライアント起動時にモーダル ダイアログとして表示されます。
  - It is recommended that you proceed with caution when there are two or more dialog-type announcements at the same time, as they are very likely to adversely affect the UX.
