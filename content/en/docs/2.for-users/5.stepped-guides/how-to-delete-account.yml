  Some users may find that they no longer need their Misskey accounts and may wish to delete them. On this page, we will provide information about:

  - Points to consider when deleting an account
  - How to delete an account

  :::danger

  As we will explain in more detail later, **deleting an account will affect even when you resume using Misskey (i.e., re-register).**
  Please be very careful when deleting your account.

  ## Points to Consider When Deleting an Account
  When you delete your account, the following will occur:

  - You will no longer be able to log in to your account.
  - Data deletion will take some time.
  - The same ID cannot be used again.

  Let's explain each point.

  ### You will no longer be able to log in to your account
  Once you delete your account, you will no longer be able to log in to it. **There is no recovery function in case of accidental deletion.** Please take note of this.

  ### Data deletion will take some time
  Data deletion is a resource-intensive operation. Therefore, to avoid disrupting other users' usage, data deletion will take some time.

  Please note that not all data will be deleted immediately upon account deletion.

  ### The same ID cannot be used again
  Due to the technical limitation on federation, at present, once an ID (the part before `@` in `@someone@misskey.example.com`) is obtained, **it cannot be used again.**

  **You will not be able to obtain the same ID again on the same server,** so please be cautious.

  After understanding all of the above, and if you still need to delete your account, please select your device type below and proceed with the account deletion.
