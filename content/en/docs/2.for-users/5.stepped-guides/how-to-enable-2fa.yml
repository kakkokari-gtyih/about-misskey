          A code for setting up two-factor authentication app will be generated. Set it up using one of the following methods:

          ### If setting up the authentication app on your current device

          Tap the "Launch App" button. If this button is not available, **tapping on the QR code will launch the app.**

          :::tip

          If it doesn't launch, make sure the two-factor authentication app is properly installed.

          :::

          ### If setting up the authentication app on another device

          Open the two-factor authentication app on the other device and follow the app's instructions to register a new one-time password. Scan the QR code displayed on the screen during this process.

          Later in the setup on the Misskey side, there will be a step to input the one-time password generated by the authentication app to confirm that it was set up correctly.

          Follow the app's instructions to either remember or copy the one-time password.

          :::warning

          The one-time password expires quickly (about 30 seconds), so please be careful.

          **Two-factor authentication setup is complete.**

          Finally, download the "Backup Codes" that can be used if two-factor authentication becomes unavailable.

          :::warning

          Backup codes are a last resort to log in to your account when one-time passwords are not available.

          If you don't have these codes, you won't be able to log in to your account, so be sure to download and store them in a safe place.

          These codes will not be displayed again.
