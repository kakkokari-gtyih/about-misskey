# Word Mute

When a note is filtered using word mute, the note will be collapsed and the text "[Name] said something" will be displayed in its place.

The word mute filter can be configured in [Settings > Mutes and Blocks](x-mi-web://settings/mute-block).

It is also possible to hide notes filtered by word mute completely.In [Settings > General](x-mi-web://settings/general), in the "Note display" section, select "Hide notes containing muted words".
