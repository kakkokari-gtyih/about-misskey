# Custom Emoji

Custom Emoji is a feature that allows you to use images uploaded to the instance as emoji. They can be used in places such as notes, reactions, chat, self-introductions, and names. To use a custom emoji in those places, press the emoji picker button (if present) or type `:` to display emoji suggestions. If a string of the form `:foo:` is found in the text, the `foo` part is interpreted as a custom emoji name and replaced by the corresponding custom emoji when displayed.

To see which custom emoji are available on the server, go to "Custom Emoji" in the [**Server Info**](x-mi-web://about#emojis) section of Misskey Web.
