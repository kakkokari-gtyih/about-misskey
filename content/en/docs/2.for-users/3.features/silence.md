# Silence

An account can be in a silenced state.

When an account is silenced, the user will no longer be able to set their note visibility to "Public".A silenced user can still set note visibility to "Home", "Followers", and "Direct", which shows the note to their followers and on their profile page, but their posts will not be visible on the GTL (federated timeline) or LTL (local timeline).

Only instance admins/moderators can silence accounts.
