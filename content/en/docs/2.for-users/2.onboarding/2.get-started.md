# Find a Misskey Server

Misskey is a software and a project.
The server running Misskey, which is publicly available on the Internet is called a **Server**.
To use Misskey, you create an account on one of these servers and use that server.

You can choose any server from the [server list](/servers/).

Misskey has federated functionality.

Misskeyには連合機能が備わっています。

This federated functionality allows users on different servers to follow, react, and renote in the same way as users on the same server, even if they are on different servers.

The federated functionality that Misskey incorporates is based on an open common standard called ActivityPub and is compatible with other software such as Mastodon and Pleroma.

## How to choose a server

### Server Theme

Some servers may have a specific theme, for example, "I like certain a thing or things".
We recommend that you look for a server with a theme that suits you.
