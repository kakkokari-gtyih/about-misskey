:::g-details{summary='Details'}
Misskey has federated functionality.

This federated functionality allows users on different servers to follow, react, and renote in the same way as users on the same server, even if they are on different servers.

The federated functionality that Misskey incorporates is based on an open common standard called ActivityPub and is compatible with other software such as Mastodon and Pleroma.
